                        <p>I was born March 14th 1987 in Menorca, a small island of the Balearic Islands. </p>
                        <p>From a very young age I knew that two things were very interesting to me: studying and gaming. As a result, I ended up moving to Barcelona to study a degree, which led to a masters, which (for some reason, sometimes a mystery to myself) led to a PhD in NLP, now working as a PostDoc. During my study years, I also fell in love with Starcraft 2, bought 4 mechanical keyboards (not at the same time) and bought a pretty sweet gaming pc. Somehow I also found love and could not be happier right now (I know, as a computer science major, this part seems unlikely but hey, I was lucky).</p>

                        <h3 class="tm-gold-text">As a Researcher</h3>
                        <p>I studied Computer Science in the Politechnical University of Catalonia (UPC)</p>
                        <p>I then worked for a while as a full-stack web developer in Incubio. Which was a very ambitious startup incubator that was too ambitious and that recently went bankrupt. While I worked there I used PHP, javascript (jquery, jquery mobile, phonegap), html/css, MySQL, MongoDB and worked a lot with REST APIs and in web crawling.</p>
                        <p>While I was working for Incubio I found out that my thirst for knowledge was still huge. I didn't want to work as a web developer for the rest of my life so I wanted to expand my academic background. To do so I enrolled in the Masters Degree of "Intelligent Interactive Systems" in the Pompeu Fabra University of Barcelona (UPF), see <a href="https://www.upf.edu/web/iis">MIIS WebPage</a> for more information. There I learnt a lot about several topics such as: NLP, planning, robotics, machine learning, etc. I started to work on Author Profiling under the supervision of Dr. Leo Wanner.</p>
                        <p>For some reason I ended up following up my work on Author Profiling in a PhD, which I also got under the supervision of Dr. Leo Wanner in the UPF. I ended my PhD with several publications in relevant NLP conferences.</p>
                        <p>During my Master and PhD I started teaching undergrads as well, which was something I am enjoying much more that I would've thought of. I have been teaching the following subjects: Databases (seminars and lab sessions), NLP (theory, seminars and labs) and Data Structures and Algorithms 2 (theory, labs and seminars).</p>

                        <p>
                            I got my first console when I was probably 5 or 6, it was the NES (with a lot of games pre-installed). I played quite a bit of that console, but since I was so young, the games were quite challenging (I'm looking at you original Castlevania). I liked Karateka and Mario Bros 1-3 quite a bit.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            But the first console that I truly loved was the Sega MegaDrive. I got it a couple of years later and I played that console A LOT. Every Sonic game, Aladdin (which was very challenging for a Disney-related game), the Lion King game (damn, Disney had some awesome games back then), and specially the one and only Streets of Rage. I still work with the Streets of Rage 1 soundtrack usually. I started playing with my brother-in-law with Fifa 95 and 96, which was the start of a great tradition of playing football games on Sundays after lunch. I also started playing fighting games, namely Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 and Super Street Fighter 2. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Then Playstation came out. My mother bought it to me, throwing away my MegaDrive (cause why would I want two consoles, one with many games and the other only with 1), which was pretty not-cool. But PS1 was the future, so I forgot about that quickly and started playing very cool games such as Soul Blade (basically the first of the Soul Calibur Saga), Final Fantasy VII, Metal Gear Solid 1, Both Dino Crisis (the second one is AWESOME) and Tekken 3. PS2 was the natural followup, which ended up being my favourite console PERIOD. The Pro Evolution Saga was my favourite game to play with my roommates. I fell in love with Kratos in the God of war saga, loved MGS2 and 3 and in general, loved the PS2 (being also the cheapest DvD player of that era, was also pretty cool). PS3 came out and sucked (no more football games, every one of them SUCKED). In paralel I played a lot of some PC games such as Age of Empires 2, the first Sims game, Starcraft 1, Unreal Tournament and specially Quake 3 Arena (which is the reason why I don't wear contact lenses anymore, I got too concentrated and not blinked enough, so they fell).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In paralel I also got into handheld consoles, I had the original GameBoy (the heavy brick-sized one) and moved on to Game Boy Color, which was without a doubt my favourite Game Boy of all time. I played Pokemon Blue up to 100% completion, played every Wario game, Tetris, the Marios, but specially, GBC's Mario Golf, which was great. The following Game Boys were not as cool for me. I also got a PSP at some point, but that was not that great in general (had some great God of war games tho).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I got a decent PC, because I was tired of programming with a small laptop which burned when you used it for a while. As a result, I also started playing PC games, which opened up a whole experience. I fell in love with Blizzard: I got into Diablo 3 a lot during the end of my degree. Also played some of my favourite games of all time in that time period such as Fallout 3, Fallout New Vegas, Skyrim and Borderlands 2. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Then I fell in love with Starcraft 2. The game is and was so challenging that I loved it. I started following the competitive scene and became very dedicated to learning and improving. Started playing seriously at the start of Heart of the Swarm. Came out of bronze playing Protoss (and 4-gating everyone), was gold when I decided to switch to zerg. Still playing zerg, now in Diamond (between 2-3). I also try to stream a bit under the name of Capitanmartu, which has always been my online persona.
