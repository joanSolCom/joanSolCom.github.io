                        <li>Author Profiling: What kind of person wrote a text? Is it a man or a woman? Is the author young or old? Is he from Barcelona or from Moscow? Author profiling deals with the identification of demographic traits of the writer of a text. The main hypothesis of this task is that people that share demographic traits also share linguistic patterns that can be identified to characterize the type of person that wrote a text.</li>
                        <li>Author Identification: Given a set of texts and a set of potential authors, identify which one of the authors is most likely the author of a text. The hypothesis here is that the writing style of an author is unique enough to be automatically distinguished from a set of candidates.</li>
                        <li>Feature Engineering: Given a classification problem, characterize the instances in a way that a machine learning algorithm effectively distinguishes between the possible labels.</li>

                                Alzheimer's disease leads to a degradation of vocabulary and communication skills. This makes us assume that writings of individual authors can be classified automatically into "pre-Alzheimer's period'' and "Alzheimer's period''. But the writing style of an author is highly individual. Can we still detect whether any given novel is written by an author who suffers from Alzheimer's? To assess this, we use a corpus of novels by three well-known writers who were diagnosed with Alzheimer's: Iris Murdoch, Terry Pratchett and Agatha Christie. Using a mostly stylistic set of features we are able to distinguish between novels written under the influence of the disease and novels written by healthy writers with more than 82% accuracy. The classification of the novels of a given author into "pre-Alzheimer's period'' and "Alzheimer's period'' is accomplished with more than 86% accuracy.

                                Author and author gender identification are two major tasks in the context of profiling of authors of written material. Author identification (or, more precisely, “authorship attribution”) copes with the assignment of the author, who is to be chosen from a given list of author names, to a piece of written material. Gender identification deals with the prediction of the gender of the author (male vs. female). Both tasks are very relevant to a number of applications, including, e.g., plagiarism and deception detection, document authenticity verification, and blackmailing. State of the art in both fields tends to rely mainly upon lexical and token (sequence) distribution features. But this means to neglect numerous linguistic studies that clearly indicate the high relevance of “deep linguistic”, i.e., syntactic and discourse, features to the characterization of the style of an author or a group of authors. Our work on author and gender identification confirms this relevance. We show with two different genres, namely blog posts and literary writings, that the use of deep linguistic features is very effective. It leads to  > 78% (in the case of blog posts) and  > 91% (in the case of literary writings) of accuracy in author identification and  > 89% (blog posts) and  > 90% (literary writings) of accuracy in gender identification.

                                Videogame streaming platforms have become
                                 a paramount example of noisy usergenerated
                                 text. These are websites where
                                 gaming is broadcasted, and allows interaction
                                 with viewers via integrated chatrooms.
                                 Probably the best known platform
                                 of this kind is Twitch, which has more
                                 than 100 million monthly viewers. Despite
                                 these numbers, and unlike other platforms
                                 featuring short messages (e.g. Twitter),
                                 Twitch has not received much attention
                                 from the Natural Language Processing
                                 community. In this paper we aim at
                                 bridging this gap by proposing two important
                                 tasks specific to the Twitch platform,
                                 namely (1) Emote prediction; and
                                 (2) Trolling detection. In our experiments,
                                 we evaluate three models: a BOW baseline,
                                 a logistic supervised classifiers based
                                 on word embeddings, and a bidirectional
                                 long short-term memory recurrent neural
                                 network (LSTM). Our results show that
                                 the LSTM model outperforms the other
                                 two models, where explicit features with
                                 proven effectiveness for similar tasks were
                                 encoded.

                                The majority of approaches to author profiling and author identification focus mainly on lexical features, ie, on the content of a text. We argue that syntactic dependency and 
                                discourse features play a significantly more prominent role than they were given in the past. 
                                We show that they achieve state-of-the-art performance in author and gender identification 
                                on a literary corpus while keeping the feature set small: the used feature set is composed of 
                                only 188 features and still outperforms the winner of the PAN 2014 shared task on author

                                Authorship attribution deals with the prediction of the author of a (usually written) discourse. This is of high relevance to a number of applications, including plagiarism detection, authenticity verification and deception detection. So far, most of the state-of-the-art approaches to author attribution rely mainly upon lexical and token (sequence) distribution features. But this means to neglect numerous linguistic studies that clearly indicate the high relevance of syntactic features to the characterization of a personal style of an author. We show in an experiment with 26 authors that indeed the use of syntactic features helps us to achieve a >77% an accuracy.

                                Author profiling and Gender Identification have gained relevance in the last few years. The goal of the research in these fields is to extract certain demographic information on the authors of texts by analyzing their writing at several levels. In our work, we address the problem of the identification of the gender (male vs. female) of the authors of opinion pieces published online. Unlike the overwhelming majority of the proposals, we argue that the use of deeper linguistic features (i.e., syntactic and discourse structure), instead of mainly lexical features leads to a higher accuracy of gender identification. Using such features with supervised machine learning, we achieve very competitive results with accuracies over 84%.

                                In most of the research studies on Author Profiling, large quantities of correctly labeled data are used to train the models. However, this does not reflect the reality in forensic scenarios: in practical linguistic forensic investigations, the resources that are available to
                                profile the author of a text are usually scarce. To pay tribute to this fact, we implemented a Semi-Supervised Learning variant of the k
                                nearest neighbors algorithm that uses small sets of labeled data and a larger amount of unlabeled data to classify the authors of texts by
                                gender (man vs woman). We describe the enriched KNN algorithm and show that the use of unlabeled instances improves the accuracy
                                of our gender identification model. We also present a feature set that facilitates the use of a very small number of instances, reaching
                                accuracies higher than 70% with only 113 instances to train the model. It is also shown that the algorithm also performs well using publicly available data.

                                In data-driven gender identification, it has been so far largely assumed that the same types of (mostly content-oriented) data features can be used to differentiate between male and female authors. In most cases, this distinction is done in a monolingual scenario. In this work, we discuss a set of features that distinguish between genders in six different datasets 
                                of blog data in English, Spanish, French, German, Italian and Catalan with accuracies that range from 77% to 88%. Using a reduced set of language-independent structural features in a multilingual scenario we first identify the gender and then the gender and language of the 
                                author, achieving accuracies higher than 74%.

                                "Deep-syntactic" dependency structures bridge the gap between the surface-
                                syntactic structures as produced by state-of-the-art dependency parsers and semantic 
                                logical forms in that they abstract away from surfacesyntactic idiosyncrasies, but still keep 
                                the linguistic structure of a sentence. They have thus a great potential for such downstream 
                                applications as machine translation and summarization. In this demo paper, we propose an 
                                online version of a deep-syntactic parser that outputs deep-syntactic structures from plain 
                                sentences and visualizes them using the Brat tool. Along with the deep-syntactic structures, 
                                the user can also inspect the visual presentation of the surface-syntactic structures that serve 
                                as input to the deep-syntactic parser and that are produced by the joint tagger and syntactic 
                                transition-based parser ran in the pipeline before deep-syntactic parsing takes place.

                            This paper describes our submission for the WCPR14 shared task on computational 
                            personality recognition. We have investigated whether the features proposed by Soler and 
                            Wanner (2014) for gender prediction might also be useful in personality recognition. We 
                            have compared these features with simple approaches using token unigrams, character 
                            trigrams and liwc features. Although the newly investigated features seem to work quite well 
                            on certain personality traits, they do not outperform the simple approaches.

                            Over the last years, author profiling in general and author gender identification in particular have become a popular research area
                            due to their potential attractive applications that range from forensic investigations to online marketing studies. However, nearly all
                            state-of-the-art works in the area still very much depend on the datasets they were trained and tested on, since they heavily draw on
                            content features, mostly a large number of recurrent words or combinations of words extracted from the training sets. We show that using
                            a small number of features that mainly depend on the structure of the texts we can outperform other approaches that depend mainly on the
                            content of the texts and that use a huge number of features in the process of identifying if the author of a text is a man or a woman. Our
                            system has been tested against a dataset constructed for our work as well as against two datasets that were previously used in other papers.
